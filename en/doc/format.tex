\section{General code format}

As a general rule, code must be well structured and organized, as well as
properly documented.

To guarantee code readability and an homogeneous format, code will be formatted
with \textgood{clang-format}. A common configuration will be used as the one
that you will find below:

\lstinputlisting{int/.clang-format}

To format code you can place the file \textemph{.clang-format} in the root
directory of your project. Most development environment will recognize the file
and will automatically format your code.

You can also consult other ways to apply the format in the tool documentation:
\url{https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html}.
