\subsection{Rules oriented to performance}

All these rules are under category
\cppid{performance}.

Below, main applicable rules are described.

\begin{itemize}

\item \cppid{performance-avoid-endl}:
Use of \cppid{std::endl} shall be avoided.
Instead, character \cppstr{'\textbackslash{}n'} shall be used.

\item \cppid{performance-enum-size}:
Size for enumerated types shall always be specified.

\item \cppid{performance-no-int-to-ptr}:
Conversions from integral types to pointer types shall be used.

\item \cppid{performance-type-promotion-in-math-fn}:
Implicit promotion from \cppkey{float} to \cppkey{double} shall be avoided
in invocations to the C mathematical library (e.g. \cppid{sin()}).
Instead, the corresponding function from the C++ mathematical library
shall be invoked (e.g. \cppid{std::sin()}).

\end{itemize}
