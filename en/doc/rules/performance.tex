\subsection{Rules oriented to performance}

All these rules are under category
\cppid{performance}.

\subsubsection{Applicable Rules}

The main applicable rules are summarized below. Please note that there are many more
rules in this category that are enabled. If you need a detailed explanation of any of them,
you can consult the \textemph{clang-tidy} manual.

\begin{itemize}

\item \cppid{performance-avoid-endl}:
Use of \cppid{std::endl} shall be avoided.
Instead, character \cppstr{'\textbackslash{}n'} shall be used.

\item \cppid{performance-for-range-copy}:
In \textmark{range-based for loops}, copying the loop variable on each iteration
shall be avoided if it has an expensive copy operation. In that case, take the
variable by const reference.

\item \cppid{performance-no-int-to-ptr}:
Conversions from integral types to pointer types shall be used.

\item \cppid{performance-type-promotion-in-math-fn}:
Implicit promotion from \cppkey{float} to \cppkey{double} shall be avoided
in invocations to the C mathematical library (e.g. \cppid{sin()}).
Instead, the corresponding function from the C++ mathematical library
shall be invoked (e.g. \cppid{std::sin()}).

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Excluded Rules}

The following rules shall not be applied:

\begin{itemize}

\item \cppid{performance-enum-size}.

\end{itemize}
