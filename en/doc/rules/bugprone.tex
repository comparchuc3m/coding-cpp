\subsection{Rules to avoid common mistakes}

All these rules are under category
\cppid{cppcoreguidelines}.

Below, main applicable rules are described.

\begin{itemize}

\item \cppid{bugprone-assert-side-effect}:
Side effects in assertion evaluation (with \cppid{assert()}) shall be avoided.
This rule also applies to side effects with assertions from \textmark{GSL}:
\cppid{Expects} y \cppid{Ensures}.

\item \cppid{bugprone-assignment-in-if-condition}:
No assignment shall be performed inside the condition of an \cppkey{if} statement.

\item \cppid{bugprone-bool-pointer-implicit-conversion}:
No implicit conversion from \cppkey{bool*} to \cppkey{bool} shall be performed.

\item \cppid{bugprone-casting-through-void}:
No conversion involving \cppkey{void*} shall be performed.

\item \cppid{bugprone-easily-swappable-parameters}: 
No function shall have consecutive parameters from the same type that can be confused.

\item \cppid{bugprone-implicit-widening-of-multiplication-result}: 
A \cppkey{static\_cast<>} shall be used to convert to an integral wider type.
If needed header \cppid{<cstddef>} shall be included.

\item \cppid{bugprone-misplaced-widening-cast}:
Implicit conversions to wider types in calculations shall be avoided.

\item \cppid{bugprone-switch-missing-default-case}:
A \cppkey{switch} statement shall always include a \cppkey{default} alternative.

\end{itemize}
