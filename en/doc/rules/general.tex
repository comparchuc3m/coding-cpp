\subsection{General rules}

In general, the following principles must be considered:

\begin{itemize}

\item No global variables shall be used except constants.

\item No primitive array (C-type array) shall be passed to 
a function as a pointer parameter.

\item No function or member function shall have more than 4 parameters.

\item No function shall have more than 25 lines when properly formatted.

\item All parameters shall be passed to functions by value, by reference
or by const reference.

\item Functions \cppid{malloc()} or \cppid{free} shall not be explicitly invoked.

\item Operators \cppkey{new} or \cppkey{delete} shall not be explicitly invoked.

\item No macros use is allowed, except for defining include guards.

\item No cast shall be performed except
\cppkey{static\_cast}, \cppkey{dynamic\_cast} or \cppkey{const\_cast}.

\item \cppkey{reinterpret\_cast} shall be used only when passing parameters
to functions form the standard library (e.g. \cppid{read()} or \cppid{write()}.

\end{itemize}
