\section{Coding rules}

As a general rule, you are recommended to follow \textmark{C++ Core
Guidelines} 
(available at
\url{http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines}).
However, it is not mandatory to follow those rules.

The detailed description of the rules checked by \cppid{clang-tidy}
may be found at
\url{https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/list.html}.

To automatically check the rules you may use a configuration as
the following:

\lstinputlisting{int/.clang-tidy}

To check the rules you may place the file \textemph{.clang-tidy} in the
root directory of your project. Most development environments will recognize
the file and will perform the checks.

You can also use other ways to apply the checks that can be found at
\url{https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/index.html}.

Below you will find a set of rules that must be followed.
